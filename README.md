## Introduction

Fast data serialization solution for Unity. Has been used in two commercial products for redemption machines.

Uses Unity's built-in JSON serializer, but does simple data sanitization using regular expressions.

## Install

The package is available on the openupm registry. You can install it via openupm-cli.

```bash
openupm add com.hww.xijson
```
You can also install via git url by adding this entry in your manifest.json

```bash
"com.hww.xijson": "https://github.com/hww/XiJSON.git#upm"
```

## Usage 

For MonoBehaviour, just inherince your class from JsonBehaviour. For ScriptableObject, just inherince from JsonObject.
After that the importing and exporting will read and write data to the StreamingAssets folder.
